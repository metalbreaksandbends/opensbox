	// Primary / secondary attack, modelled on GMod's SWEP. You write one PrimaryAttack that spends ammo
	// (TakePrimaryAmmo) and fires the shot. It runs once, on whoever controls the weapon - the owning
	// client for a held weapon, the host for seats/NPCs/world weapons. The client is authoritative over
	// its own shots: it traces against the world it sees (so hits land where the shooter aimed, no lag
	// compensation) and reports them to the host as hit claims, which the host applies - and can reject
	// (see BaseCombatWeapon.HitClaims). Ammo spends are mirrored to the host, which owns the magazine.
	//
	// The inventory pumps OnControl on the owning client: it reads input and fires the attack.
